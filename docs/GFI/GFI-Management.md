# Good First Issue (GFI) Management Guidelines

## Purpose

This document describes **how Good First Issues (GFIs)** should be managed once they are created.

Clear management practices help:
- Ensure GFIs remain welcoming and actionable
- Provide consistent contributor experiences
- Balance maintainer workload with community engagement

These guidelines focus on **maintainer responsibilities and discretion** and are intended to be applied at the **SDK level**.

---

## What Is GFI Management?

**GFI management** refers to the ongoing actions maintainers take to ensure that:
- Issues labeled as `good first issue` remain suitable for new contributors
- Contributors receive timely guidance and feedback
- GFIs do not become stale, abandoned, or misleading

Management is not micromanagement; it is **lightweight stewardship**.

---

## GFI Lifecycle Overview

A Good First Issue typically moves through the following stages:

1. Identified as a potential GFI (GFIC — Good First Issue Candidate)
2. Reviewed and labeled as a GFI
3. Assigned or claimed by a contributor
4. Actively supported through contribution
5. Completed, relabeled, or closed

Not all GFIs must follow this exact flow, but clarity around expectations helps contributors succeed.

---

## Labeling and Promotion (GFIC → GFI)

Maintainers may use an intermediate **Good First Issue Candidate (GFIC)** state.

### Recommended Practices

- Use a `good first issue candidate` (or similar) label to flag potential GFIs
- Promote an issue from GFIC → GFI once:
  - Scope and acceptance criteria are clear
  - The issue meets `GFI-guidelines.md`
  - Maintainer capacity exists to support it

Maintainers are not required to promote every GFIC to a GFI.

---

## Assignment and Claiming

Maintainers may choose how contributors engage with GFIs.

### Common Approaches

- Allow contributors to self-assign
- Assign first-time contributors upon request
- Limit the number of simultaneous GFI assignments per contributor

### Recommended Guidance

- Prefer assigning **one contributor per GFI**
- Avoid long-term assignment without activity
- Reclaim or unassign issues after prolonged inactivity, with a clear comment

This ensures fair access and avoids stalled issues.

---

## Mentorship and Support

Mentorship is encouraged but **not mandatory**.

### Examples of Supportive Management

- Answering clarification questions
- Pointing contributors to relevant files or examples
- Clarifying acceptance criteria
- Suggesting incremental approaches

### What Is *Not* Expected

- Writing the solution for the contributor
- Providing extensive code reviews beyond GFI scope
- Guaranteeing real-time or synchronous support

Light guidance is often sufficient for a successful first contribution.

---

## Review Expectations (“Soft Review”)

Maintainers may choose to apply a **lighter review standard** for GFIs.

### Soft Review May Include

- Prioritizing clarity and correctness over optimization
- Offering constructive, educational feedback
- Allowing minor follow-up improvements after merge

### Still Required

- Correctness
- Tests where applicable
- Compliance with project standards

GFIs should be welcoming, not lower-quality.

---

## Maintainer Discretion and Control

Maintainers retain full control over:

- Labeling or removing the `good first issue` label
- Assignment decisions
- Pausing or closing GFIs
- Adjusting management practices over time

Discretion allows maintainers to adapt to workload, contributor behavior, and project priorities.

---

## Transparency and Community Engagement

Maintainers are encouraged to:
- Leave brief comments when relabeling or closing GFIs
- Explain pauses or changes in availability
- Encourage contributors to ask questions

Transparency builds trust and helps the community understand expectations.

---

## Updating GFI Management Practices

This document is intended to be **easy to update**.

Maintainers may:
- Adjust management practices at any time
- Experiment with different levels of mentorship or review
- Align management with `GFI-frequency.md` and maintainer capacity

Updates should be treated as **process guidance**, not rigid policy.

---

## Relationship to Other GFI Documents

This document complements:
- `good_first_issues_guidelines` — what qualifies as a GFI (docs/maintainers/good_first_issues_guidelines.md)
- `GFI-frequency.md` — how many GFIs to support
- Issue templates and labeling conventions

Together, these documents provide a complete view of:
- GFI definition
- GFI availability
- GFI stewardship

---

## Summary

Effective GFI management is:
- Supportive
- Sustainable
- Transparent

A well-managed Good First Issue benefits contributors, maintainers, and the SDK as a whole.
