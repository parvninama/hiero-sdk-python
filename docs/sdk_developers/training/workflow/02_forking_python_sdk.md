## Forking the Python SDK

To begin contributing to the Python SDK, you’ll first need your own copy of the repository.

Forking creates a personal, editable version of the SDK under your own GitHub account, where you can safely experiment and prepare pull requests without impacting the Python SDK.

### Steps to Fork the Python SDK

1. Navigate to the Python SDK Repository

Open the [Official Python SDK repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python)

2. Create Your Fork
Make sure you are logged in to GitHub. Then, in the top-right of the repository page, click Fork.

GitHub will prompt you to confirm:
- The destination account (your profile)
- The name you want to give your fork (you can keep the default)

Click Create fork.

Your new fork will appear at:
`https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>`
This is your copy of the Python SDK. You can also access it from your repository section on GitHub online.


3. Clone Your Fork Locally

You now have an online copy of the Python SDK but you also need a local copy to work on the code.

Using GitHub Desktop (recommended):
1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Go to File → Clone Repository
3. Select the fork you just created under the “Your Repositories” tab.
4. Choose a folder location on your machine and click Clone.
