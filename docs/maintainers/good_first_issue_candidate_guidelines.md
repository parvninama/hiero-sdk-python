# Good First Issue — Candidate Guidelines  
**Hiero Python SDK**

## How to Use This Document

This guide is intended to support **maintainers and issue creators** who use the  
**`good first issue: candidate`** label.

It provides shared language and guidance to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Flag issues that *might* be a good starting point for new contributors  
- Identify where additional clarity or detail is needed  
- Prepare issues for promotion to a full Good First Issue  

**Maintainers:**
- Protect the quality and trustworthiness of Good First Issues  
- Give issues time to be refined before promotion  

This document is not a strict rulebook, and it is not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.  
All contributions are valuable to the Hiero project.

The **candidate** label simply helps ensure that Good First Issues offer a smooth and confidence-building first experience.

## What the Candidate Label Is For

The **`good first issue: candidate`** label is used to mark issues that *appear* suitable for first-time contributors, but may still need a bit more clarity, polish, or confirmation before being promoted to a full **Good First Issue (GFI)**.

It provides a safe “holding state” where maintainers can refine the issue without prematurely advertising it as ready for new contributors.

The candidate label is **not** a softer or lower-quality GFI — it is a **preparation stage**.

---

## Why This Label Exists

Some issues look small and approachable, but may still be missing:

- Clear step-by-step instructions  
- Explicit file paths or locations  
- Well-defined acceptance criteria  
- Confidence about difficulty or scope  

The candidate label helps signal:

> “This issue is close — it just needs a little more detail before it’s ready.”

This protects the credibility of the Good First Issue label and helps ensure a positive experience for new contributors.

## When to Use `good first issue: candidate`

Apply the **candidate** label when an issue appears suitable for a Good First Issue, but is **not fully ready yet**.

### ✅ Potentially a Good First Issue

The issue likely qualifies because:

- The change appears small, localized, and low risk  
- The task fits within allowed GFI categories (documentation, examples, typing, or small mechanical edits)  
- The issue does not require exploration, investigation, or design decisions  

Suitability can be evaluated using the

[**Good First Issue Guidelines**](./good_first_issues_guidelines.md)

---

### ✅ Needs Refinement Before Promotion

One or more of the following is still missing:

- Explicit step-by-step implementation instructions  
- Clear and objective acceptance criteria  

At this stage, the issue may include partial notes, rough ideas, or reminders for maintainers to clarify later — and that’s okay.

---

### ✅ Difficulty Is Uncertain

Use the candidate label when:

- The issue *seems* easy, but you are not fully confident  
- The scope or effort needs maintainer confirmation  

The candidate stage allows time to confirm that the issue is truly appropriate for first-time contributors.

If an issue turns out to be more complex, it is usually better labeled as a **Beginner Issue** instead of a GFI.

---

## What a Candidate Is NOT

The candidate label is intended for issues that are potential Good First Issues but may need additional detail or scoping to be fully beginner-friendly.

### ❌ Not for Issues Requiring Decisions

If a contributor must decide:

- *What* should change  
- *How* something should behave  
- *What* is correct or expected  

Then the issue is **not** a candidate.

---

### ❌ Not for Core or Behavioral Changes

Do not use the candidate label for issues involving:

- SDK or protocol behavior  
- Public APIs or contracts  
- `to_proto` / `from_proto` logic  
- Serialization, deserialization, or networking  

---

### ❌ Not for Exploratory or Blocked Work

Avoid using the candidate label for:

- Investigations or debugging tasks  
- Issues blocked on other PRs or decisions  
- Work requiring domain or protocol knowledge  

> ⚠️ If an issue clearly does *not* meet Good First Issue criteria,  
> do **not** label it as a candidate.  
> The candidate label is for issues that *might* qualify after refinement — not for issues that never will.

---

## Promoting a Candidate to Good First Issue

An issue should only be promoted to a full **Good First Issue** once it is clearly ready for first-time contributors.

### ✅ Readiness Checklist

Before promoting an issue to Good First Issue, consider checking whether:

- [ ] The problem is clearly described and easy to understand for someone new to the project.
- [ ] The solution is **explicitly specified**  
- [ ] The change is small, localized, and low risk  
- [ ] The issue touches a single file or clearly defined location  
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are objective and complete  
- [ ] No interpretation, investigation, or initiative is required  

---

### 🔁 Promotion Process

1. Review the issue against the [**Good First Issue Guidelines**](./good_first_issues_guidelines.md)
2. Add missing details, steps, and acceptance criteria  
3. Remove the `good first issue: candidate` label  
4. Apply the **Good First Issue** label  

There is no rush — taking the time to refine an issue is part of creating a welcoming and supportive community.
