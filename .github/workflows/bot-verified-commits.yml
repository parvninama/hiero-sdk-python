            Hi, this is VerificationBot. 
            Your pull request cannot be merged as it has **unverified commits**. 
            View your commit verification status: [Commits Tab]($COMMITS_URL).
            
            To achieve verified status, please read:
            - [Signing guide](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/sdk_developers/signing.md)
            - [README](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)
            - [Discord](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/discord.md)

            Remember, you require a GPG key and each commit must be signed with:
            \`git commit -S -s -m "Your message here"\`

            Thank you for contributing!
