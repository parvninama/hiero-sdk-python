#!/bin/bash

# ==============================================================================
# Executes When:
#   - Run by GitHub Actions workflow: .github/workflows/pr-check-changelog.yml
#   - Triggers: workflow_dispatch (manual) and pull_request (opened, edited, synch).
#
# Goal:
#   It acts as a gatekeeper for Pull Requests, blocking any merge unless the user
#   has added a new entry to CHANGELOG.md and correctly placed it under the
#   [Unreleased] section with a proper category subtitle.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Flow: Basic Idea
#   1. Grabs the official blueprints (upstream/main) to compare against current work.
#   2. Checks if anything new was written. If not, fails immediately.
#   3. Walks through the file line-by-line to ensure new notes are strictly filed
#      under [Unreleased] and organized under a category (e.g., "Added", "Fixed").
#   4. If notes are missing, misplaced, or dangling, it fails the build.
#      If filed correctly, it approves the build.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Flow: Detailed Technical Steps
#
# 1️⃣ Network Setup & Fetch
#    - Action: Sets up a remote connection to GitHub and runs 'git fetch upstream main'.
#    - Why: Needs the "Source of Truth" to compare the Pull Request against.
#
# 2️⃣ Diff Analysis & Visualization
#    - Action: Runs 'git diff upstream/main -- CHANGELOG.md'.
#    - UX/Display: Prints raw diff with colors (Green=Additions, Red=Deletions)
#      strictly for human readability in logs; logic does not rely on colors.
#    - Logic: Extracts two lists:
#      * added_bullets: Every line starting with '+' (new text).
#      * deleted_bullets: Every line starting with '-' (removed text).
#    - Immediate Fail Check: If 'added_bullets' is empty, sets failed=1 and exits.
#      (You cannot merge code without a changelog entry).
#
# 3️⃣ Context Tracking 
#    As the script reads the file line-by-line, it tracks:
#    - current_release: Main version header (e.g., [Unreleased] or [1.0.0]).
#    - current_subtitle: Sub-category (e.g., ### Added, ### Fixed).
#    - in_unreleased: Flag (0 or 1).
#       * 1 (True)  -> Currently inside [Unreleased] (Safe Zone).
#       * 0 (False) -> Reading an old version (Danger Zone).
#
# 4️⃣ Sorting
#   Flag is ON (1) AND Subtitle is Set 	    -> correctly_placed    		    -> PASS ✅
#   Flag is ON (1) BUT Subtitle is Empty    -> orphan_entries       		-> FAIL ❌ (It's dangling, not under a category)
#   Flag is OFF (0)          				-> wrong_release_entries	    -> FAIL ❌ (edited old history)
#
# 5️⃣ Final Result
#    Aggregates failures from Step 4. If any FAIL buckets are not empty, exit 1.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parameters:
#   None. (The script accepts no command-line arguments).
#
# Environment Variables (Required):
#   - GITHUB_REPOSITORY: Used to fetch the upstream 'main' branch for comparison.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - git (must be able to fetch upstream)
#   - jq (required for PR context parsing)
#   - grep, sed (standard Linux utilities)
#   - CHANGELOG.md (file must exist in the root directory)
#
# Permissions:
#   - 'contents: read' (to access the file structure).
#   - Network access (to run 'git fetch upstream').
#
# Returns:
#   0 (Success) - Changes are valid and correctly placed.
#   1 (Failure) - Missing entries, wrong placement (e.g. under released version),
#                 orphan entries (no subtitle), or accidental deletions.

⚠️ **Changelog placement issue**

Thanks for adding a changelog entry! 🙌  
However, one or more entries in this PR were added under a **released version**.

📌 New changelog entries should always go under **[Unreleased]**, grouped beneath an appropriate category (e.g. *Added*, *Fixed*).

Please move the following entries to **[Unreleased]**:

\`\`\`
$wrong_release_entries
\`\`\`


Let us know if you’re unsure where it should live — happy to help!"
