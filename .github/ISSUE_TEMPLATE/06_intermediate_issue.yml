        ## **Thanks for contributing!** 😊

        We truly appreciate your time and effort. 
        This template is designed to help you create an Intermediate issue.

        The goal is to create an issue for users that have:
        - basic familiarity with the Hiero Python SDK codebase
        - experience following our contribution workflow
        - confidence navigating existing source code and examples
        ---

      description: Who is this issue for?
      value: |
        This issue is intended for contributors who already have some familiarity with the
        [Hiero Python SDK](https://hiero.org) codebase and contribution workflow.
  
        You should feel comfortable:
        - navigating existing source code and examples
        - understanding SDK concepts without step-by-step guidance
        - following the standard PR workflow without additional onboarding
  
        If this is your very first contribution to the project, we recommend starting with a few
        **Good First Issues** before working on this one.

        > ### 🧭 What we consider an *Intermediate Issue*
        >
        > This issue generally:
        >
        > - Requires **some knowledge of the existing codebase**, but not deep architectural knowledge
        > - Is **narrowly scoped** and well-contained
        > - Is **low to medium risk**, not touching highly sensitive or critical DLT logic
        > - May involve **refactors or small feature additions**
        > - Provides **enough documentation or examples** to reason about a solution
        > - Often has **similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase**
        >
        > **What this issue is NOT:**
        > - A beginner-friendly onboarding task
        > - A large architectural redesign
        > - A change requiring extensive cross-module refactors
        > - A breaking API change

        Describe the problem clearly and precisely.

        You may assume the reader:
        - understands the SDK structure
        - can navigate `src/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`
        - is comfortable reading existing implementations

        Still, explain:
        - what is wrong or missing
        - where it lives in the codebase
        - why it matters

        ## 🐞 Problem – Example

        The `TransactionGetReceiptQuery` currently exposes the `get_children()` method,
        but the behavior is inconsistent with how child receipts are returned by the Mirror Node.

        In particular:
        - The SDK always returns only the parent receipt
        - There is no way to opt-in to retrieving child receipts
        - Similar query objects already support optional flags to extend the response

        This limitation makes it difficult to inspect scheduled or child transactions
        without issuing additional manual queries.

        Relevant files:
        - `src/hiero_sdk_python/query/transaction_get_receipt_query.py`
        - `examples/query/transaction_get_receipt_query.py`

        This does NOT need to be a full implementation plan,
        but should explain:
        - what should change
        - what should NOT change
        - any constraints or boundaries

        ## 💡 Expected Solution – Example

        Introduce an optional configuration flag on `TransactionGetReceiptQuery`
        that allows callers to explicitly request child receipts.

        The change should:
        - Be opt-in (default behavior must remain unchanged)
        - Reuse existing response parsing logic where possible
        - Avoid introducing breaking API changes

        Example usage:

        ```python
        receipt = (
            TransactionGetReceiptQuery()
            .set_transaction_id(tx_id)
            .set_include_children(True)
            .execute(client)
        )
        ```

        ## 🧠 Implementation Notes – Example

        Likely steps:

        - Add an optional boolean field (e.g. `_include_children`) to
          `TransactionGetReceiptQuery`
        - Ensure the flag is passed to the mirror node request
        - Update response parsing to include child receipts when present
        - Extend the existing example in
          `examples/query/transaction_get_receipt_query.py`
          to demonstrate the new behavior

        Similar patterns can be found in other query classes that support
        optional response extensions.
